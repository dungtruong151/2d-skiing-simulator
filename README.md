# 2d-skiing-simulator
**Abstract:** 2D Ski Simulator is an engaging winter sports game that challenges players to control a skier down a snowy slope while avoiding obstacles and collecting coins. The game offers three difficulty modes—Easy, Normal, and Hard—each offering a unique level of challenge with varying terrain, obstacles, and speed. Players control the skier’s movements by intuitively tilting left and right, as well as jumping to avoid hazards. The game features dynamic environmental effects, including interactive snow particles and terrain, for added realism. With smooth character animations, varied obstacles, and a variable difficulty curve, 2D Ski Simulator offers a fun and immersive experience for players of all skill levels.
